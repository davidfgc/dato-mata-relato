Following the domain entity ADR pattern (see ADR-001-domain-entity-structure-pattern.md), create a new entity class for [ENTITY NAME] in the appropriate entities directory.

Then, replace all usages of the old [ENTITY NAME] interface or type throughout the project with the new entity class, updating imports and usages as needed. Finally, delete the old [ENTITY NAME] file.

Make sure to:

Use private constructors and factory methods (create, fromPersistence)
Implement getters, business methods, and toPersistence
Enforce validation and business rules as described in the ADR
Ensure no direct property access or public fields remain
Let me know when the migration is complete.
